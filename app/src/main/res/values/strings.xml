    <string name="positiveDetails01">Received a positive COVID diagnosis? Getting a COVID test is not the best piece of news to receive right now. However, once you get the news, it is important to decide the next course of action. While over 80% of cases are mild or moderate in nature, not every patient requires hospitalization. Knowing what to do, when to seek help can fasten your recovery time and help you get back on your feet better. Hence, it is important to have a COVID plan ready.</string>

    <string name="negativeDetail04">Help them with grocery shopping, filling prescriptions, and getting other items they may need. Consider having the items delivered through a delivery service, if possible.</string>
    <string name="negativeDetail05">Have their doctor’s phone number on hand. Use CDC’s self-checker tool to help you make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care. Call their doctor if the person keeps getting sicker. For medical emergencies, call 911 and tell the dispatcher that the person has or might have COVID-19.</string>
